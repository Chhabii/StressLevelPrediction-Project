            <h4 style="line-height: 1.5;">An acute stress reaction occurs when a person experiences certain symptoms after a particularly stressful event. The word 'acute' means the symptoms develop quickly but do not last long. The events are usually very severe and an acute stress reaction typically occurs after an unexpected life crisis. This might be, for example, a serious accident, sudden bereavement, or other traumatic events. Acute stress reactions may also occur as a consequence of sexual assault or domestic violence.

                Acute stress reactions have been seen in people who experience terrorist incidents, major disasters, or war. Military personnel are at more risk as a result of extreme experiences during conflicts.
                
                An acute stress reaction usually resolves within 2 to 3 days (often hours).</p>
